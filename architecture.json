The AI also posed two questions regarding the placement of a \"Submit\" button: whether it should be at the bottom of the form or fixed at the bottom of the screen, and what action it should take upon being pressed, either saving the data and redirecting to the home page or showing a confirmation message on the same page. The user continued by asking for a \"Submit\" button, to which the AI confirmed it would be added. Subsequently, the user requested a button labeled \"hello world,\" prompting the AI to ask for further details about the project.\nAI: Great, adding a button with the text \"Hello World\".\nUser: add a button that says hello world\nAI: Acknowledged, adding a button with text \"Hello World\".\nUser: add a button that says hello world\nAI: Got it, I'll add a navbar with navlinks for home, about, and contact.\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made: add a button that says Submit"
